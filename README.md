# TaskGPT Project

TaskGPT is a modular AI-powered application composed of three core services:

- **TaskGPT LLM** – Natural language processing and reasoning powered by LangChain, Groq/OpenAI.
- **TaskGPT UI** – Frontend interface built with Angular and Python integration.
- **TaskGPT DB** – Persistent storage layer using PostgreSQL.

All services communicate seamlessly through **FastAPI**, ensuring a robust, scalable, and traceable architecture.

- **Modular Design**: Separate services for UI, LLM, and DB, organized as Git submodules.
- **AI Integration**: LangChain orchestration with Groq/OpenAI models for advanced task reasoning.
- **Modern Frontend**: Angular-based UI with Python backend hooks.
- **Reliable Storage**: PostgreSQL database with structured schema for task persistence.
- **FastAPI Communication**: Lightweight, high-performance API layer connecting all services.
